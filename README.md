## ⚡ Features  
✔️ **Throttle Example:** Reduces function calls for high-frequency actions like scrolling & mouse movement.  
✔️ **Debounce Example:** Delays execution until the user stops typing (e.g., search input).  
✔️ **Performance Comparison:** See event call counts with and without optimizations.  
✔️ **Smooth UI Experience:** Prevents excessive function calls that cause UI lag.
